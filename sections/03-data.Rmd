# Data

## Materials

The Master and Movement data from the transmission system operator amprion of the years 2012 to 2019 prepared by the energy agency of RLP is used to analyze the electricity yield mainly over the rated capacity and the commissioning date. Amprion lists 1,702 WT's in RLP in 2019. In comparison the Structure and Approval Directorate North registers 1,704 WT's with technical details and coordinate references that are connected to the public grid. In addition the marked master data register (MaStR) of the Federal Network Agency @Marktstammdatenregister.2020, in which all electricity and gas generation systems must be registered, is used. The MaStR contains technical details of the WT's and also the exact coordinate references of their location but not the electricity yield. The data from amprion and the MaStR both contain a system key according to the Renewable Energy Law, by which they can be joined to a single data set which contains the electricity yield as well as the coordinates for the assessment of the area consumption per quantity of generated electricity.

For the preparation and the analysis of the data R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31) -- "Shake and Throw" and RStudio Version 1.4.1106 were used. Due to exhaustive code and iterative preparation steps the full documentation can not be displayed here but is to be found on [https://github.com/EliasCuadra/master-thesis-repowering](https://github.com/EliasCuadra/master-thesis-repowering) with explanatory README.md files that contain description of variables and processing steps. Nonetheless, important aspects or code chunks are directly included or can be found in the appendix.

## Methods

### Data from the transmission system operator Amprion from 2012 to 2019

For the data analysis the years 2012 to 2019 are considered but in most cases only more recent years are investigated because the WT technology is constantly improving and old data would not contain these new developments and therefore lead to an underestimation of future values. The data from Amprion comes with 28 or rather 27 variables for the year 2019 of which only some are interesting for the further analysis. Thus, a preparation process must initially be carried out to clean and prepare the data. The kept variables are: Community key, post code, place, rated capacity, commissioning date, system key and electricity yield. For the prediction  of the electricity yield not all the WT's are meaningful and some outliers are removed from the data. On the one hand WT's with a rated capacity under 100 kW are considered too small for a reasonable assessment of new commercially operated systems. On the other hand some  WT's are listed with a rated capacity up to 12 MW which might be because several WT's are registered as one. It is therefore assumed that a rated capacity larger than 4,5 MW does not reflect the average conditions, even though systems of this size exist. Also WT's that are build in the same year after the 15th of February are excluded since they have less time to generate electricity and therefore deliver misleading data. The data from 2017 shows 1,623 WT's in total of which 101 are outliers. The data from 2018 shows 1,674 WT's of which 76 are outliers. The data from 2019 shows 1,702 WT's of which 46 are outliers. The same is done for the years 2015 and 2016. An interim result are five csv files of the different years that only have relevant variables in the correct format and are free of outliers. Only the data from 2019 is further processed and variables for the county and municipality names as well as the electricity yield in MWh and the full load hours are added. The data from 2019 is then divided in three files according to the commissioning date to find the WT's that are build either before 2005, before 2001 or between 2001 and 2005 and are therefore potentially suitable for a repowering process. A flow chart of the individual processing steps that have been performed is presented in figure \@ref(fig:preparation).

```

After the preparation, the data is firstly analyzed regarding the amount of electricity generated per WT and year. For this purpose, a linear and a 3rd order polynomial regression, that allow for a forecast until 2030, is carried out. The amount of electricity fed in, here referred to as the electricity yield, is the dependent variable and the commissioning date as the independent variable. Secondly the electricity yield is plotted over the rated capacity and henceforth only linear trends are applied to generate more conservative and appropriate estimation of the future values. For the next analysis a plot of the rated capacity over the commissioning date is generated. For this only data from 2019 is used since the rated capacity of the already installed WT's do not change over time. Further the full load hours as a concept of the degree of utilization is analyzed in regard of the WT's commissioning date. The degree of utilization might be more dependent on the wind conditions than the technical development and is therefore specifically good for predictions and therefore data from the past 5 years is analyzed. In addition to the wind conditions the full load hours depend on the specific nominal output, which means the rotor diameter, and hence the technological development can not be disregarded. Which means concrete that old data might still deliver a wrong impression on future predictions but also might account for weak years in terms of wind conditions since 2019 might be a stronger wind year.

Since it is crucial not only to know the electricity yield per WT but also the electricity yield per area to estimate how much of the area of Rhineland-Palatinate must actually be covered with WT's in order to achieve the target of 20 TWh of wind energy in 2030. Therefore data from the master data register that contains geographic information about the WT's is used to calculate their area consumption and the according process is described next.

### Data from the market master data register (MaStR)

The MaStR contains data about all electricity and gas power generation units and can be freely accessed here: [https://www.marktstammdatenregister.de/MaStR/Einheit/Einheiten/OeffentlicheEinheitenuebersicht](https://www.marktstammdatenregister.de/MaStR/Einheit/Einheiten/OeffentlicheEinheitenuebersicht). The electricity units with the generation type "wind" for Rhineland-Palatinate that are in operation are extracted on the 23th of July 2021 as a CSV file, which counts 1,752 WT's with 50 variables of which only 8 are kept; The rated capacity, the commissioning date, the community key, the coordinates (WGS84), hub height, rotor diameter and EEG system key. It does not contain the amount of electricity fed into the public grid. Thus, to calculate the electricity generation per area the data of the MaStR and amprion needs to be joined together according to the EEG system key. The process of preparing the MaStR data and joining it with the data from amprion of 2019 is shown as a flow chart in figure  and the R code is stored as MaStR_amprion.R in the MaStR_amprion folder. The result are 1,620 WT's that could be correctly assigned and are ready for further analysis.
