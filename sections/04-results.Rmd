## Electricity yield, rated capacity and full-load-hours in Rhineland-Palatinate 

The diagnostics of the electricity yield show in all linear and polynomial models the same characteristics. Even if they slightly differ from each other and the model assumptions might not be 100 % optimal for regression analysis they are also not fundamentally violated. The residual vs fitted values plot show that the residuals become greater with increasing value for the electricity yield. This makes sense since the rated capacity for WTs increases and therefore changes the magnitudes of electricity generation over time. The normal QQ plot shows that the residuals of average values are normally distributed but as the values become great or small there is clear deviation from a normal distribution. This might be due to the non-linear development of the WT technology. The scale location plots reveal that the residuals are more or less spread equally among the range of predictors with slightly increasing variance with increasing values, which must be like this since this was already indicated in the residuals vs fitted values plot. The residuals vs leverage plot shows that none of the observations is without Cook's distance and therefore there is no influential outlier. The plot with all  models of the electricity yield over the commissioning date as a main result shown in figure \@ref(fig:electricityyield).

All models are highly significant with p-values less than 0.001 and the linear models have R\textsuperscript{2} values of 0.68 - 0.70, which means that around 70 % of the variation in the electricity yield can be explained by the commissioning date. By using a 3\textsuperscript{rd} order polynomial formula the value for R\textsuperscript{2} increases to up to 73 %. This value could not significantly be increased by using a higher order. This means that the fit of the model can be slightly improved using the polynomial model but it might lose prediction power due to the bias variance trade-off. Intuitively an infinitely or exponentially growing electricity yield is of course not realistic from a physical or technical point of view. Therefore, the prediction of the polynomial models of more than 15,000 MWh/a per WT on average in the year 2030 seems very high and the assumption of 10,000 MWh per WT of the linear trends is more reasonable. However, the DWG forecast in figure \@ref(fig:capacity) shows a disproportionate increase in the average nominal power, which in turn means that at locations with optimal wind conditions and rapidly advancing technology, disproportionate growth in electricity yield per WT is possible. Additionally, as presented in chapter 2.3, the WT manufacturers give reason to believe that the electricity output per year will increase to 15,000 - 20,000 MWh/a with an average wind speed of 6 m/s within the next years. Nonetheless, only a few locations have optimal conditions and the older systems reduce the average output. 

For the following plots and trends the diagnostics and significance is not further discussed since there is no sign of abnormalities apart from the patterns that occur due to the steps in which the rated capacity of generators increase and the assumed non-linear technological development. The plot of the electricity over the rated capacity is shown in figure \@ref(fig:eratedcapacity).

\newpage

As expected the electricity yield increases with increasing rated capacity and therefore also more recent commissioning date because the size and generator technology has continued to advance. Also do those linear trends capture the predicted 15,000 MWh/a electricity yield per year of the V162-5.6 IEC S with a rated capacity of 5,600 kW given that the wind speed in RLP is a little lower as in the data sheet of the manufacturer. Noticeable is the steeper increase in 2017 over the year 2018 which suggests different annual wind conditions that might influence this trend significantly. But not only the overall electricity yield increases also the variance increase. This is also logical since the different and fluctuating wind conditions lead to a greater magnitude of difference in electricity yield when using a larger generator. It can also be seen that the rated capacity clusters around certain values which is due to the availability and performance of specific generator series. Common sizes are 2, 3 or 3.7 MW but are also available in between. To generate the average electricity of 10,000 MWh/a that were presented before, turbines with and average rated capacity of 5 MW seem to be required. The plot of the rated capacity over the commissioning date with data from 2019 is shown in figure \@ref(fig:ratedcapacity). It displays again the characteristic pattern of specific rated capacity values and the mean of 3,500 kW installed power in 2021 per WT as well as a prediction for the year 2030 with 4,500 kW using a linear trend. Using a polynomial trend does not neither improve nor change this result. Similarly the study of the DWG shows a predicted rated capacity of around 3.5 MW in 2021 and an even higher rated capacity of around 5.5 MW in 2030. Hence, the average generator size of 3.5 MW for the current moment can be used for calculations.

\newpage

The next plot shows the full-load-hours over the commissioning date in figure \@ref(fig:full). The linear trends for the year 2015 until 2019 have more or less the same slope and are not deviating strongly. This indicates relatively stable conditions. It also seems that the more recent the data the higher the estimates, which could be explained through increasing technology especially again the increasing rotor diameter and therefore the reduced specific nominal power is decisive. On the contrary the estimation of the data from 2015 is among the highest, even though the latest technology is not reflected here. The year 2017 also has higher full-load-hours than the year 2018. This nicely reflects the fluctuation in wind conditions and means that the years 2015 and 2017 might be better wind years than the years 2016 and 2018 but it also shows that the difference is within a small range and does not influence the overall perspective of ten years. The mean of all models for 2021 is around 2,300 h/a and is therefore recommended for further calculation. 

```{r full, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="full-load-hours over the commissioning date using data from 2015 - 2019", out.width = "100%", fig.pos="H"}
knitr::include_graphics("data/Amprion/results_of_analysis/flh.png")
```

The prediction for 2030 is around 2,800 h/a on average. If this is compared to the study of the DWG it can be seen that the DWG similarly shows average full-load-hours for the south of Germany in 2000 of around 1,300 and in 2016 of around 2,000 and the prediction for 2021 lies equally at around 2,300 h/a. The estimation for 2030 of the study of DWG shows a lower value of less than 2,500 h. This might be because the study of the DWG uses more data from different sources, probably a more sophisticated model and also the prediction is done for the whole of southern Germany. But it seems as to calculate with the value of 2,300 full-load-hours does definitely not lead to an overestimation. Divided by the total number of hours per year the full load hours reveal a load factor of around 26 %, which is much more than the mentioned 19 % from the literature @DavidJCMacKay.2009 from 2009. This can, again, be well explained through the increasing rotor and decreasing specific nominal power which leads to a better utilization of weak winds. Lastly if we multiply the estimated full-load-hours of 2,300 by the average rated capacity for 2021 of 3.5 MW the result is 8,050 MWh/a, which is higher than the linear trends suggest. This is because the development of the rated capacity and the rotor diameter are actually not completely captured by a linear relationship. If compared to the polynomial models with estimations for the year 2021 of around 8,000 - 10,000 MWh/a this result seems more similar.

If an an average electricity generation of 7,400 MWh/a per WT is assumed the number of WTs needed to generate the demanded 22 TWh is around 2,973 WTs. If on average 8,050 MWh/a could be harvested then this would require around 2,733 WTs. It seems that if the average growth of the total number of WTs in RLP continues as predicted initially, the goal of around 2,500 WTs in RLP is very realistic. If the 22 TWh shall be generated with 2,500 WTs the average annual output must be 8,800 MWh, which also seems quit realistic because the numbers presented before are first conservative and second estimates for the year 2021 and will certainly increase over the next ten years. Of course, WTs with lower total electricity yield would have to be repowered additionally to increase the mean output and effort has to be made to push ahead with the expansion of WTs in RLP, but it shows that it is certainly not out of the scope. 

On the contrary to the technical potential, due to legal reasons and resistance from the citizens, the increase was slowed down sharply from 92 newly commissioned WTs in 2017 to 27 newly commissioned WTs in 2019 @EnergieagenturRheinlandPfalz.2019. Experts from the wind industry particularly criticize the difficult approval procedures. The biggest mistake of the federal government was to introduce an "obligation to tender" for new wind turbines that slows down the whole process @NickSchader.2021. In the end of this section it is to mention that this increasing development should not be misunderstood that the overall electricity yield of an area can be increased in the same way. Larger WTs have to be spaced further apart, so even though they might have a higher electricity yield, the overall electricity yield per area might not increase as much as expected. Although there might be strong economic reasons to build greater WTs and also to harvest higher wind speeds at greater altitudes, the overall energy extraction per area has certain limits that cannot be exceeded. Therefore the calculations of the respective area consumption are presented in subsections 4.3. Before that the repowering potential is investigated next.




## Repowering potential

The WTs in RLP that are potentially suitable for repowering within the next 10 years are systems with commissioning date before 2006. If possible this means a total replacement of 514 WTs with a total electricity output of 841 GWh. If we assume, by looking into chapter 4.1 and figure \@ref(fig:electricityyield), that the average electricity yield of a newly commissioned WT within the next 10 years can be 12,500 MWh on average the combined electricity yield of 514 WTs of that kind would be 6,425 GWh or roughly 6.4 TWh which is well above seven times more than before. Further, the 514 WTs have been arbitrarily divided into the categories; commissioned before 2001 and between 2001 and 2005 to see the influence of the commissioning date and are listed in (table \@ref(tab:table1)). It is highly questionable if all of the old systems can be replaced due to distance regulations and approval procedures because larger WTs might have an accordingly larger area consumption due to larger rotor diameter. But it could also be possible that the areas in which old systems are already in use due to good wind conditions are chosen for further harvesting of the winds energy and that more WTs will be built in those places. This consideration is beyond the scope of this thesis.

```{r table1, echo=FALSE}
col_names <- c(
  "Commission", "Number of WTs", "Electricity yield [GWh]", "Potential [GWh]", "Increase [\\%]"
)
means     <- c(
  "before 2001", 186, 186, 2325, 1250
)
stddev    <- c(
  "2001 to 2005", 328, 655, 4100, 625
)

df <- matrix(data = c(means, stddev), nrow = 2, byrow = T)
colnames(df) <- col_names
df <- data.frame(df)
knitr::kable(
  df,
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = "Repowering potential based on the 100 % replacement of wind turbines commissioned either 
  before 2001 or from 2001 to 2005.",
  col.names = col_names, 
  escape = FALSE
) %>%
kable_styling(latex_options = c("HOLD_position")) %>%
row_spec(2, hline_after = T)
```

 
I want to argue that repowering is in this context a misleading term since it suggests that a system is technically enhanced, but in this case it means the deconstruction of old systems and new building of another system, which might even be in a different location. This is also why the approval procedures and distance regulations and also measures to protect the environment are not different as in the case of first construction of a WT. Thus, for a technical assessment of the wind energy potential in RLP, the respective electricity yield per WT and especially per area is determining. Whether and how WTs are repowered is then once the potential is assessed an economic and legal consideration. Hence, the calculation of the area consumption follows next.

## Rotor diameter, hub height and area consumption

The analysis of the merged data from Amprion and the MaStR revealed a average rotor diameter of around 86.5 m and about 110 m hub height on average. The plots of the rotor diameter and hub height over time with a linear trend up to 2030 is shown in figure \@ref(fig:rotorhub). A steady increase can be seen as the reasons for that have already been explained and the expected average rotor diameter in 2030 is about 150 m and the average hub height around 200 m. As described before this kind of sizes are already been offered by the big manufacturing companies.

```{r rotorhub, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Rotor diameter and hub height of WTs in RLP over the commissioning date from 1990 to 2019 with linear trend to the year 2030", out.width = "100%", fig.pos="H"}

```

For the purpose of analyzing the electricity density data points that would distort the results are taken away from the initial 1,589 WTs and 1,216 remained. The plot that shows the electricity yield per m\textsuperscript{2} which can be reffered to as the electricity density per year over the commissioning date of the merged data set that originated from the MaStR and the master and movement data from Amprion of 2019 is show in  figure \@ref(fig:eyarea). Although the model is highly significant only 11 % of the variation in the depended variable is explained by the commissioning date. Therefore and because almost 400 WTs had to be taken out of the data set because of missing or unrealistic numbers the overall prediction power of the model is low.

```{r eyarea, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Electricity density in kWh/ m² and year over the commissioning date", out.width = "100%", fig.pos="H"}

```


Nonetheless, the average distance to the nearest WT of all WTs is a reasonable 412 m which equals to an area consumption per WT of about 169,744 m\textsuperscript{2} or roughly 0.17  km\textsuperscript{2}. This means that the total area covered with currently 1,702 WTs is about 289.34 km\textsuperscript{2}, this equals to around 1.46 % instead of the 1.8 % that were theoretically derived in chapter 2.1 of the total area of RLP which is 19,858 km\textsuperscript{2}. This is either because the assumption of 6 m/s is actually wrong and the wind speed in RLP is higher or the distance between WTs is smaller thant five times the rotor diameter. To reiterate this area is neither only the site were the WT is located nor the swept area of the rotor but already considers the distance around a WT in which no other WT can be built.

With an electricity yield of 6.782 TWh in 2019 this means that the average electricity yield per area and year equals to around 23,44 kWh/m\textsuperscript{2}a which is a constant power output of about 2.675 W/m\textsuperscript{2}. This exceeds the value of 2.2 W/m\textsuperscript{2} if compared to the literature value from 2009 with an assumed average wind speed of 6 m/s that was introduced in chapter 2.1 and calculated in formula 4 and 6. The actual average wind speed must be 6.35 m/s to reach a power output of about 2.61 W/m\textsuperscript{2} and a distance to the next WT of 5 times the rotor diameter. Hence, this is definitely an indicator for the utilization of higher wind speeds in greater altitude with the technical development towards greater hub heights and that the value of five times the rotor diameter is too high for newly commissioned systems and therefore changes the proportions. The increase in rotor diameter alone cannot explain this development if the WTs have to be spaced further apart as seen in formula 6. The average distance to the next WT in relation to the rotor diameter is 4.9 which is relatively close to the five times the rotor diameter mentioned earlier and in the literature @DavidJCMacKay.2009.

Due to the constant technical development it makes sense to take more recent years for future predictions. Thus, only the results of the WTs with a commissioning date after 2010 are used for further analysis. The distance to the nearest neighboring WT increases then up to 467 m, but decreases in relation to the rotor diameter to 4.6 times the diameter. This might be due to increasing rotor diameter but limited space. This leads to an interesting trade-off between greater and more efficient WTs and the occurring shadowing effect that reduces the efficiency of a wind park. The average area consumption of a WT built after 2010 is around 238,527 m\textsuperscript{2} which is 0.243 km\textsuperscript{2}. The average electricity yield is about 30.5 kWh/m\textsuperscript{2} which relates to a constant power output of 3.47 W/m\textsuperscript{2}. Hence, the electricity yield per area is increasing over time and the reduced distance between WTs in relation to their rotor diameter and with it possible shadowing effects are surpassed by the effect of utilizing greater wind speeds at higher altitudes. The other way round this means that if the distance between WTs can be reduced the overall wind speed to generate this electricity density significantly goes down which means a smaller area consumption. If the increase in efficiency can be kept with increasing rotor diameter and a reduced or similar area consumption, the rotor diameter has indeed again a big impact on the overall electricity yield. This trade-off between the possibility of energy extraction with rotors and the respective demand in space should therefore be examined in further studies, that an exact threshold of this trade off can be defined.

According to the project development companies and the manufacturers a distance to the neighboring WT can be reduced to 3 times the rotor diameter. If we look at a Vestas V162-5.6 IEC S with a rotor diameter of 162 m which relates to an area consumption of around 236,196 m\textsuperscript{2} according to the previous assumption the expected electricity yield at 6 m/s is around 15,000 MWh. This means the electricity density is about 63.5 kWh/m\textsuperscript{2} per year which relates to a constant power output of around 7.2 W/m\textsuperscript{2}. This also means that the 40.5 kWh/m\textsuperscript{2} on average presented in figure \@ref(fig:eyarea) for the year 2030 could be realistic. According to the presented numbers three possible scenarios using the mean predicted for 2021 and 2030 as well as the calculation from the Vestas WT as well as the required wind speed to generate that electricity density and the respective area consumption if the goal of 22 TWh should be reached in 2030 are shown in table \@ref(tab:table2). It must be mentioned that for the calculation of the required wind speed it is assumed that the distance of 3 times the rotor diameter that was used to calculate the electricity density of a new Vestas WT was also used for the other scenarios, but the value for 5 times the rotor diameter is put into brackets to show the significant difference that the distance to the next WT has.

 Linow @SvenLinow.2020, if compared with the occurrence of this wind speed shown in figure \@ref(fig:wind) at 140 m above ground, it seems rather unlikely. 
 
 Nevertheless, despite some problems regarding regulations and approval processes it is definitely clear that the average hub height is steadily increasing and to be expected above the mentioned 140 m (figure \@ref(fig:nabe)).
 
Additionally after the year 2030 a further increase in electricity demands through electrification is expected and covering more than 4 % of the area with WTs will of course also increase people's concerns and resistance. Therefore, it is still questionable if the state of RLP will succeed in fulfilling their goals on supplying two thirds of their electricity demand from own wind power. Nonetheless, this work showed that the potential is certainly given.
