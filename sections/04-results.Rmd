## Electricity yield, rated capacity and full load hours in Rhineland-Palatinate 

The overall development of the number of WT's in RLP is shown in figure \@ref(fig:yearswts), which shows an estimated number of WT's of around 2,500 in the years 2030.

The diagnostics of the electricity yield show in all linear and polynomial models the same characteristics. Even if they slightly differ from each other and the model assumptions might not be 100 % optimal for regression analysis they are also not fundamentally violated. In figure \@ref(fig:diagnostic) the diagnostic plots of the electricity yield over the commissioning date from the year 2019 are shown as an example. The residual vs fitted values plot show that the residuals become greater with increasing value for the electricity yield. This makes sense since the rated capacity for WT's increases and therefore changes the magnitudes of electricity generation over time. The normal QQ plot shows that the residuals of average values are normally distributed but as the values become great or small there is clear deviation from a normal distribution. This might be due to the non linear development of the WT technology. The scale location plots reveal that the residuals are more or less spread equally among the range of predictors with slightly increasing variance with increasing values, which must be like this since this was already indicated in the residuals vs fitted values plot. The residuals vs leverage plot shows that none of the observations is without Cook's distance and therefore there is no influential outlier.

All models are highly significant with p-values lower than 0.001 and the linear models have R\textsuperscript{2}-values of 0.68 - 0.70, which means that around 70 % of the variation in the electricity yield can be explained by the commissioning date. By using a 3\textsuperscript{rd} order polynomial formula the value for R\textsuperscript{2} increases to up to 73 %. This value could not significantly be increased by using a higher order. This means that the fit of the model can be slightly improved using the polynomial model but it might loose prediction power due to the bias variance trade-off. Intuitively an infinitely or exponentially growing electricity yield is of course not realistic from a physical or technical point of view. Therefore, the prediction of the polynomial models of more than 15,000 MWh per WT on average in the year 2030 seems too high and the assumption of 10,000 MWh per WT of the linear trends more reliable. However, the DWG forecast in figure \@ref(fig:capacity) shows a disproportionate increase in the average nominal power, which in turn means that at locations with optimal wind conditions and rapidly advancing technology, disproportionate growth in electricity yield per WT is possible. Nonetheless, only few locations have optimal conditions and a more conservative estimation is chosen in this context, which might be different in the assessment of single sites. The plot of the data and all trends are shown in figure \@ref(fig:electricityyield). For the given reason the average electricity yield of the three linear trends in 2021, which amounts to 7,400 MWh per WT, together with the upcoming results from the rated capacity and full load hours is used for further calculations.

```

For the following plots and trends the diagnostics and significance is not further discussed since there is no sign of abnormalities apart from the patterns that occur due to the steps in which the rated capacity of generators increase and the assumed non-linear technological development. The plot of the electricity over the rated capacity is shown in figure \@ref(fig:eratedcapacity).  

```{r eratedcapacity, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Electricity yield over rated capacity", out.width = "100%", fig.pos="H"}
knitr::include_graphics("data/Amprion/results_of_analysis/electricity_rated_capacity.png")
```

As expected the electricity yield increases with increasing rated capacity and therefore also more recent commissioning date because the size and generator technology advances continuously. It can also be seen that the rated capacity clusters around certain values which is due to the availability and performance of specific generator series. But not only the electricity yield increases also the variance increase. This is also logic since the different and fluctuating wind conditions lead to a greater magnitude of difference in electricity yield when using a larger generator. To generate the average electricity of 7,400 MWh/a that were presented before, as a minimum, a 3.5 MW turbine must be used on average. The plot of the rated capacity over the commissioning date with data from 2019 is shown in figure \@ref(fig:ratedcapacity). It displays again the characteristic pattern of specific rated capacity values and the mean of 3,500 kW installed power in 2021 per WT as well as a prediction for the year 2030 with 4,500 kW using a linear trend. Similarly the study of the DWG shows a predicted rated capacity of around 3.5 MW in 2021 and an even higher rated capacity of around 5.5 MW in 2030. Hence, this 3.5 MW are used for further calculations.

```

The next plot shows the full load hours over the commissioning date in figure \@ref(fig:full). The linear trends for the year 2015 until 2019 have more or less the same slope and are not deviating strongly. This indicates relatively stable conditions. It also seems that the more recent the data the higher the estimates, which could be explained through increasing technology especially again the increasing rotor diameter and therefore the reduced specific nominal power is decisive. On the contrary the estimation of the data from 2015 is among the highest, even though the latest technology is not reflected here. The year 2017 also has higher full load hours than the year 2018. This nicely reflects the fluctuation in wind conditions and means that the years 2015 and 2017 might be better wind years than the years 2016 and 2018. The mean of all models for 2021 is around 2,300 h/a and is therefore used for further calculation. The prediction for 2030 is around 2,800 h/a on average. If this is compared to the study of the DWG it can be seen that the DWG similarly shows average full load hours for the south of Germany in 2000 of around 1,300 and in 2016 of around 2,000 and the prediction for 2021 lies equally at around 2,300 h. The estimation for 2030 of the study of DWG shows a lower value of less than 2,500 h. This might be because the study of the DWG uses more data from different sources, probably a more sophisticated model and also the prediction is done for the whole of southern Germany. But it seems as to calculate with the value of 2,300 full load hours does definitely not lead to an overestimation. Divided by the total number of hours per year that equals to a load factor of around 26 %, which is much more than the mentioned 19 % from the literature @DavidJCMacKay.2009 from 2009. This can, again, be well explained through the increasing rotor and decreasing specific nominal power which leads to a better utilization of weak winds. Lastly if we multiply the estimated full load hours by the average rated capacity for 2021 the result is 8,050 MWh/a, which is higher than the linear trends suggest. This is because the development of the rated capacity and the rotor diameter are actually not completely captured by a linear relationship. If compared to the polynomial models with estimations for the year 2021 of around 8,000 - 10,000 MWh/a this result seems more similar. If we assume an average electricity generation of 7,400 MWh/a the number of WT's needed to generate the demanded 20 TWh is around 2,700 WT's, if on average 8,050 MWh/a could be harvested then this would require around 2,484 WT's. It seems that if the average growth of the total number of WT's in RLP continues as predicted initially the goal of around 2,500 WT's in RLP is realistic. Of course, WT's with lower total electricity would have to be repowered additionally but it shows that is is not totally out of the scope. On the contrary the increase was slowed down sharply in the last years due to legal reasons and resistance of the citizens. In the end of this section it is to mention that this increasing development should not be misunderstood that the overall electricity yield of an area can be increased in the same way. Larger and therefore WT's with a higher electricity yield have to be spaced further apart which means the overall electricity yield per area might not increase in the same way. Although there might be strong economic reasons to build greater WT'S and also to harvest higher wind speeds at greater altitudes, the overall energy extraction per area has certain limits that can not be exceeded. The calculations of the respective area consumption are presented in subsections XV.

## Repowering potential

The potentially suitable WT's in RLP for repowering within the next 10 years are older systems which are relatively arbitrary divided into the two categories; Commission before 2001 and between 2001 and 2005 and are shown in table \@ref(tab:table1). These values are theoretical ones and represent a repowering rate of 100 \%. The electricity yield would be more than 7 times greater if all systems with a commissioning date before 2001 would be repowered and around 3.7 times as much as if additionally all systems with a commissioning date between 2001 and 2005 are repowered. This means a total replacement of 514 WT's with accordingly larger area consumption. It is also highly questionable if all of the old systems can be replaced due to the explained resons. In this context repowering is a missleading term since it suggests that a system is technically enhanced, but in this case it means the deconstruction of old systems and new building of another system, which might even be in a different location. Therefore, from a technical assessment of the windenergy potential in RLP, the respective electricity yield per WT and especially per area is decisive. Hence, the calculation of the area consumption follows next.

col_names <- c(
  "Commission", "Number of WT's", "Electricity yield [GWh]", "Potential [GWh]", "Increase [\\%]"

```


## Area Consumption

After taking WT's out of the data that would distort the results 1195 WT's remained for analysis. It is to mention that almost 400 WT's had to be taken out of the data set and also the R\textsuperscript{2}-value is not very high so the overall prediction power of the model might be low.

Nonetheless, the average distance to the nearest WT of all WT's is a reasonable 417 m which equals to an area consumption per WT of about 174,168 m\textsuperscript{2} or 0.174 km\textsuperscript{2}. This means that the total area covered with currently 1702 WT's is about 296.4 km\textsuperscript{2}, this equals to around 1.5 % of the total area of RLP which is 19,847 km\textsuperscript{2}. With an electricity yield of 6.7 TWh in 2019 this means that the average electricity yield per area and year equals to around 22.6 kWh/m\textsuperscript{2}a which is a constant power output of about 2.6 W/m\textsuperscript{2}. Compared to the literature value of 2.2 W/m\textsuperscript{2} with an average wind speed of 6 m/s this value is for an area with lower wind speeds such as RLP relatively high but still in the range of the 1 to 7 W/m\textsuperscript{2} mentioned by Linow @SvenLinow.2020, but definitely indicates higher wind speeds and therefore a technical development towards greater hub heights. The average distance to the next WT in relation to the rotor diameter is 4.9 which is relatively close to the five times the rotor diameter mentioned earlier and in the literature @DavidJCMacKay.2009.

For future predictions it makes more sense to take the results of more recent years. Thus, only these results of the WT's with a commissioning date after 2010 are analyzed. The distance to the nearest neighboring WT increases up to 474 m but decreases in relation to the rotor diameter to 4.7 times the diameter. The average area consumption of a WT built after 2010 is around 243,285 m\textsuperscript{2} which is 0.243 km\textsuperscript{2}. The average electricity yield per m\textsuperscript{2} is about 27.4 kWh/m\textsuperscript{2} which relates to a constant power output of 3.1 W/m\textsuperscript{2}. 

The plot that shows the electricity yield per m\textsuperscript{2} and year over the commissioning date of the whole joined data set that originated from the MaStR and the master and movement data from amprion of 2019 is show in \@ref(fig:eyarea). Although the model is highly significant only 11 % of the variation in the depended variable is explained by the commissioning date. Therefore it is not clear if this model is enough to make clear predictions. Therefore two scenarios are introduced in table X for the calculation of a future area consumption with an electricity demand of 22 TWh per year.
