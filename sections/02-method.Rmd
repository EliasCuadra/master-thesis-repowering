## Greenhouse gas emissions

First of all, the problem of greenhouse gas emissions will be stated briefly as the basis and motivation of this thesis. It is getting warmer, as Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist from the University of Reading impressively visualizes with his warming stripes using the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) annual global temperature data set (Figure \@ref(fig:wmo)). The color of each stripe, in which blue indicates cooler and red warmer temperature, represents the anomaly to the average annual temperature in the period of 1971-2000.

```

The debate about the significance of global warming and climate change is already omnipresent in social media, newspapers, politics, economics and science, as well as the society as a whole, and its relevance is still growing. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has brought virtually unequivocal evidence that the increase of average global temperature is related to anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations
@IntergovernmentalPanelonClimateChange.2014. The major international project to encounter climate change and adapt to its effects is the Paris Agreement, whose central aim is to minimize the threat of climate
change by keeping the global temperature increase well below 2 $^\circ$C, preferably below 1.5 $^\circ$C, of the pre-industrial level @UnitedNations.2015. The Paris Agreement requires all 196 participating countries to declare their individual according efforts through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). After missing several targets, Germany passed the Climate Protection Law in December 2019. The climate protection targets for 2030 are set to reduce GHG emissions by at least 65% compared to 1990. The law also formulates the goal of GHG neutrality by 2045. The biggest GHG emitter in Germany is the energy industry @Umweltbundesamt.2018. Consequently, to reduce its GHG emissions in the energy sector and to support the development of renewable energy power plants, Germany implemented the Renewable Energy Sources Act in 2000 with latest editions from 2017 and 2021. This law intends to support the expansion of renewable energies with the aim of 65% of electricity from renewable sources in 2030. This should be done by regulating the preferred feed-in of electricity from renewable energy sources (RES), mainly wind and sun, into the power grid as well as ensuring fixed feed-in tariffs (FIT) for a period of 20 years to ensure the fast expansion of renewable energy power plants and therefore reduce GHG emission and limit global warming @BundesamtfurJustiz.2021. 


## Region of interest

This section highlights some characteristics of Rhineland-Palatinate (RLP), the region of interest for this study, since it is important to know the site conditions and the statistical parameters of the past to assess the wind energy potential for future years. RLP has diverse geographic structures such as many low mountain ranges and forests but also plains areas. It borders North Rhine-Westphalia in the north, Hesse and Baden-Wuerttemberg in the east, the French region of Grand Est and Saarland in the south, and Luxembourg and the province of Liège in the Belgian region of Wallonia in the west. RLP is the federal state with the largest area on the left bank of the river Rhine. The climate in RLP is characterized by a moderate, humid climate with warm summers and mild to cool winters which makes it a typical Western European climate. The average annual temperature is 10.4 $^\circ$C which is 1.8 $^\circ$C above the long-term average. Settlement areas occupy around 8,6% and transport infrastructure around 6.1% of the land area @StateStatisticalOfficeofRhinelandPalatinate.2020. RLP is one of the most densely forested states in Germany, with forests covering around 42% of the state's land @HansenandLamour.2021. The assessments and calculations required for this current study demand information about wind occurrence as well as the amount of electricity generation and data from existing WTs in RLP. An overview of important parameters regarding the estimation of the wind energy potential up to the year 2030 are shown in table \@ref(tab:table0). The study area and the modeled wind speeds taken from the Windatlas RLP @MinisteriumfurWirtschaftKlimaschutzEnergieundLandesplanung.2013 are seen in Figure \@ref(fig:wind).

## Onshore wind turbines and repowering

Wind energy has been used by humans for thousands of years, but the generation of electrical power has only been possible since the 19th century with the beginning of industrialization and is now the subject of constant research and development in the context of the energy transition @Wikipedia.2021. A wind turbine usually consists of the three main components: rotor blades, nacelle and tower. In addition to other elements, the nacelle contains: the gearbox, generator, transformer and control system @MladenBosnjakovic.2013. Most commonly WTs have three rotor blades that are attached to the rotor hub and absorb the kinetic energy of the wind and convert it into a rotary motion. If the winds are too strong, the rotor blades can be “taken out of the wind” by adjusting the blade angles through the so-called pitch control, thus protecting the system from damage but also increasing efficiency through optimal speeds. The avoidance of damage through peak loads due to high wind speeds can also be prevented through the stall effect but this requires complex aerodynamic design of the rotor blades. The gearbox changes the speed of the rotary motion and the generator converts the kinetic energy into electricity. However, there are also systems with direct drive and without gear. The nacelle can be rotated to an optimal position when the wind conditions change, and an electromagnetic brake helps to shut down the system when the winds are too strong or during maintenance work. Without going into the details of technical construction, the main components of the nacelle according to Vestas, one of the largest manufacturers of WTs is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:nacelle). In addition to its load-bearing function, the tower also contains the power lines that conduct electricity to the grid connection of the distribution network @NetzKonstrukteur.16.11.2020.

```{r nacelle, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Main components in the nacelle (Vestas)", out.width = "90%", fig.pos="H"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/nacelle.png")
```

The expansion of wind power in Germany has slowed in recent years as can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:winddevelopment), which details the development of onshore WTs according to Deutsche WindGuard. The service provider Deutsche WindGuard (DWG), which has been compiling a six-monthly expansion statistics since 2012, in the complex energy market stands for independent, manufacturer-neutral advice and comprehensive scientific, technical and operational services. 

(ref:dwg) Development of expansion and dismantling of WTs in Germany from 1995 until 2021 @DeutscheWindGuard.2021.

```{r winddevelopment, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:dwg)", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/wind2.jpg")
```


As seen in Figure \@ref(fig:winddevelopment), in the first half of 2021, 240 new WTs with a rated capacity of 971 MW were installed in Germany. This corresponds to a 62% increase if compared to the first six months of the previous year. In the same period, 135 WTs with an installed capacity of 140 MW were shut down. The net expansion in the first half of 2021 is consequently 831 MW. The cumulative installed capacity increased by 1.5% to 55,772 MW as of June 30, 2021. A total of 29,715 onshore WTs are installed in Germany that provide this capacity. To achieve the expansion target for 2022 yet another net addition of around 1.2 GW is required. The target for 2030, which originates from the EEG 2021 is 71,000 MW. This number is not yet adapted by the expected increase in electricity demand in 2030. Another important player in the onshore wind energy industry is the Bundesverband Windenergie e.V. (BWE) as a member of the Federal Renewable Energy Association (BEE). The BWE represents the entire wind energy industry with its more than 20,000 members. Together, the supplier and manufacturing industry anchored in German mechanical engineering, project planners, specialized lawyers, the financial sector and companies from the fields of logistics, construction, service / maintenance and storage technologies, electricity traders, network operators and energy providers ensure that the BWE is available to all questions relating to wind energy and is the first point of contact for politics and business, science and the media. The production of WTs can usually be realized within a few months with relatively little material and energy consumption. After a short period of operation, a WT has already "brought in" the energy that was required for its production. This period is known as the energy returned on energy invested (ERoEI) or, more simply, energy return on investment (EROI) and is for WTs on land between three and seven months. Offshore systems with an even higher rated capacity need four to five months to recycle the energy used in production and installation. Due to this relatively short energetic amortization, every operating hour delivers “net” clean electricity for an average of at least 20 years @PriyanaRazdan.2019. In comparison, photovoltaic systems need between one and four years for this energetic amortization. A wind power plant can therefore provide 40 to 70 times more energy during its entire life cycle than was expended for its manufacture, use and disposal, depending on the design. If this amount of electricity replaces fossil fuels, the wind power plant can credit itself with the avoided emissions from coal and gas power plants. Of course WTs are not entirely free of emmissions but the whole amount of CO\textsubscript{2} equivalent of a WT is about 10.6 g/kWh according to Memmler et al. @M.MemmlerDr.T.LaufS.Schneider.2017 and about 400 g/kWh in the federal electricity mix @Umweltbundesamt.2021. After dismantling the old WT, a new one can be built in the same location or at least in the same area. This is referred to as repowering. The development of repowering processes according to DWG is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:repowering).

\newpage 

The electricity generation from wind energy in RLP can be traced by using data from the transmission system operators. In the case of RLP it is the transmission network operator Amprion, who publishes so-called master and movement data for the amount of electricity fed-in with remuneration for each calendar year in accordance with section 77 of the Renewable Energy Act (EEG) 2017 @Bundesgestzblatt.2017. This master and movement data includes information about the annual electricity generation and the EEG system key. The data for RLP is currently available until 2019. The total amount of electricity fed-in with remuneration in 2019 from wind turbines in RLP is approximately 6.782 TWh @EnergieagenturRheinlandPfalz.2019. The average electricity output in RLP of one WT was about 7,000 MWh in 2019 but newly commissioned WTs already have an output of more than 10,000 MWh which would be sufficient to cover the demand of 2,500 households (4,000 kWh). However, looking at current product brochures of large manufacturers, such as Vestas, Nordex or Simens Gamesa, the development potential of WTs is not yet exhausted. The annual generation of electric energy of a Vestas V162 with a nominal output of 5.6 MW, hub height up to 166 m, rotor diameter of 162 m and a swept area of 20,612 m² is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:v162). Nordex has a similar model called N163/5.X with a nominal output of 5 MW and more, a hub height of up to 164 m, rotor diameter of 163 m and a swept area of 20,867 m² @Nordex.2021. Practical experience from project developers show that wind parks with an estimated commissioning in 2025 are already planned with the next generation of onshore WT that have over 6 MW nominal power. But even now a product of Simens Gamesa called SG 6.6-170 has a nominal power of up to 6.6 MW, a hub height of up to 165 m, a rotor diameter of 170 m and a swept area of 22,697 m² @SimensGamesa.2021. This means that the expected annual output of WTs in RLP with an average wind speed of 6 m/s can be estimated with relative certainty to be 15 to 20 GWh within the next ten years.

## Spatial planning in RLP

The decisions of whether new WTs should be built depends heavily on the spatial planning and the respective regulations and laws. Therefore the different planning levels in RLP are presented in the following sections and the procedure for an aproval process is outlined roughly.

### State level

As the highest planning authority in RLP in terms of spatial planning, the Ministry of the Interior and Sport acts and thus ensures a fair balance between the various demands on the use of space as a resource. The state planning thus acts as a neutral mediator and moderator to ensure sustainable development of the state of RLP and the requirements of the state government for a social and ecological transformation regarding sustainable economic development, social integrative cohesion and responsibility for the environment reconciled. The state planning controls the comprehensive, regional and interdisciplinary planning for the state @MinisteriumdesInnernundfurSport.2021. The main legal bases of spatial planning in RLP are the federal Spatial Planning Act (Raumordnungsgesetz - ROG) and the State Planning Act (Landesplanungsgesetz - LPlG)@BundesministeriumderJustizundfurVerbraucherschutz.2008. The Spatial Planning Act primarily contains the basics of the procedure for drawing up statewide and regional spatial plans, the legal effects of the plan content, and the procedure for examining projects that are of spatial importance. The State Planning Law only has a supplementary function compared to the Spatial Planning Act. It regulates in detail the preparation of spatial plans, the implementation of spatial planning procedures and the organization of regional planning in RLP. An amendment to the State Planning Law recently made it possible for recognized nature conservation associations to be accepted as members of the regional planning communities @MinisteriumderJustizRheinlandPfalz.2003. 

The 2008 version of the State Development Program IV (Landesentwicklungsprogramm IV) from 2008 with several updates forms the coordinating and interdisciplinary spatial framework for the development of the state of RLP and specifies goals for the development of the infrastructure @MinisteriumdesInnernundfurSport.2008. Regarding wind power, the first partial update of the State Development Program IV stipulated that an orderly expansion of wind power should be ensured through regional and urban land-use planning. For the purpose of of identifying priority areas for the use of wind energy, the authority for a final control through the designation of concentration areas for wind energy was transferred to the land-use planning and the regional plans. The basic distribution of tasks between state planning, regional planning and land-use planning is retained in the third partial update of the State Development Program IV from 2017 @MinisteriumdesInnernundfurSport.2017. In order to ensure an appropriate balance between the expansion of wind energy on the one hand and the requirements of nature, landscape and cultural landscape protection as well as the needs of the population on the other hand, adjustments through an immediately applicable change are being made in the partial update of the State Development Program IV. The main innovations that are designated to give substantial space to the expansion of wind energy, with the 2% target in mind, and give special support for the repowering of old systems, taken from the Ministry of the Interior and Sport are @MinisteriumdesInnernundfurSport.2017:

**The following exclusion criteria for WTs apply:**

- In nature reserves and areas with contiguous hardwood stands over 120 years old
- In the Palatinate Forest Nature Park, national parks and core zones of nature parks
- In the core zones and in the framework areas of the UNESCO World Heritage Areas Upper Middle Rhine Valley and Upper Germanic-Raetian Limes
- In nationally significant historical cultural landscapes of assessment levels 1 and 2
- In those Natura 2000 areas for which the state bird sanctuary for Hesse, RLP and Saarland and the State Office for the Environment, Water Management and Trade Supervision in the “nature conservation framework for the expansion of wind energy in RLP” have identified a very high potential for conflict
- In water protection areas of zone I


**Modification of area specifications**. The requirement to provide two percent of the land area for the use of wind energy (Principle G 163 a) is retained in principle, but the formulation as a minimum proportion is dispensed with the deletion of the term “at least”. The same applies to the provision of forest areas (principle G 163 c).

**Minimum area size: systems in a spatial network**. The requirement that wind turbines may only be erected at locations where it is possible to build at least three systems in a network is becoming a legally binding goal (previously G 163 f, now Z 163 g). In the case of repowering, it is sufficient to erect at least two turbines.

**Minimum distance to areas with residential use**. Required minimum distance from wind turbines of 1,000 meters to pure, general and special residential areas as well as to villages, mixed and core areas and a minimum distance of at least 1,100 meters for systems with a total height of more than 200 meters (Z 163 h). Falling short of the distances is only permitted in the case of the particularly desired repowering of old systems (Z 163 i) @MinisteriumdesInnernundfurSport.2017.

### Regional level
Regional planning agencies are the planning communities for the regions Middle Rhine-Westerwald, Trier, Rheinhessen-Nahe, West Palatinate and the Association Region Rhine-Neckar for the metropolitan region Rhine-Neckar (section 12-15 State Planning Act RLP (LPlG)). The planning communities are made up of the independent cities and districts in the area of a region. In RLP, there are regional spatial plans in four planning regions and one transnational metropolitan region. These are currently being updated taking into account the content of State Development Program IV and are thus adapted to the current regulatory situation and are used to concretize the given specifications for the respective planning region @MinisteriumdesInnernundfurSport.2017.

### Local level
According to Section 5 of the Building Code (BauGB), the land use plan for the entire municipal area must outline the type of land use resulting from the intended urban development according to the foreseeable needs of the municipality @BundesministeriumderJustizundfurVerbraucherschutz.1960. It is a graphic plan representation of the entire municipal area, in which the existing land uses and those desired for the future are shown. For example, residential areas, commercial areas and arable land are displayed. This applies to areas on which these uses already exist and areas on which this use is to be established in the future. The purpose of the zoning plan is not a cartographic representation of the current situation, but rather a conceptual development plan directed towards the future. Therefore, the planning representations deviating from the actual state represent the essential content of the zoning plan, although usually occupy a much smaller area than the existing representations @MinisteriumdesInnernundfurSport.2017.

The zoning plan is therefore of particular importance for the designation of new building areas or concentration zones for wind power plants according to Section 5 (2b) of the BauGB. Positive location assignments at one or more places in the area of the administrative community mean that the remaining planning space is kept free of wind turbines and a uniform landscape is maintained, because according to Section 35 (5), a wind turbine is generally to be given preferential approval if public interests do not conflict and adequate development is assured. The exact land-use planning in a municipality is then regulated by the so-called development plan. It contains the legally binding stipulations for the urban planning order of part of a municipality and forms the basis for further measures required to implement the building code (Section 8 (1) BauGB) @BundesministeriumderJustizundfurVerbraucherschutz.1960.

### Approval 
The approval of wind turbines takes place in the approval process according to the Federal Immission Control Act (Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz - BImSchG). This is always necessary for wind turbines over 50 meters in total height. This will ensure that no harmful environmental effects or other dangers can be caused by the planned project and the project does not conflict with any other public law concerns. If this is guaranteed, the applicant has a legal right to be granted the permit (section 6 BImSchG) @BundesministeriumderJustizundfurVerbraucherschutz.2021. The district administrations or the city administrations are responsible for issuing the immission control permit. The immission control approval procedure has a concentration effect (section 13 BImSchG). This means that the other permits and approvals required for the operation of the system are also checked and approved as part of the immission control procedure. When approving wind turbines, in addition to the issue of immission control, the focus is particularly on the provisions of nature and species protection law, building regulations and building planning law. In addition, other technical issues such as aviation law or landscape and monument protection can be relevant. The technical assessment with regard to noise, shadows, operational safety and occupational safety is carried out by the structure and approval departments (Struktur- und Genehmigungsdirektion - SGD) @FachagenturWindenergieanLand.2021. 


## Energy policy program
In the newly formed coalition agreement of the government of the federal state of RLP from 2021-2026, the goal of 100% renewable energies in the electricity mix by 2030 is reaffirmed and stated: "We will vigorously expand wind power and solar energy in order to double the installed capacity for wind power... by 2030". ”This means the net expansion of 500 megawatts of photovoltaics and **500 megawatts of wind power per year**. In addition, the goal of 100% renewable energies in the electricity mix should be anchored in the Climate Protection Act". It is further stated that @FachagenturWindenergieanLand.2020:

- The rigid concentration offer in the State Development Plan IV should be abandoned, while continue to strive to establish larger wind parks 
- The sum of the rated capacity after a repowering must at least reach the sum of the output that was generated by the old system, which should nonetheless enable to reduce the number of WTs in one location
- The working with fixed distances rules, which should be 900 m for newly approved WTs and a 20% reduction for repowering systems,  should continue.
- The regulation in the State Development Plan IV (Z.163h) that the minimum distance to pure, general and special residential areas, village, mixed and core areas must be observed. The rule-exception principle applies to WTs in the core zones of nature parks. The core zones are generally excluded for WTs. A case-by-case examination should be possible where the protection goal is not significantly disrupted. 
- The medium-term goal within this legislative period is to review the nature conservation core zones and to adapt the associated ordinance. 
- It should be checked whether pre-polluted areas (railway lines, motorways, conversion areas) in the area of nature parks can be freely built upon  @SPD.2021.

## Climate protection concept RLP
The Ministry of the Environment, Energy, Food and Forests of RLP first published a climate protection concept in
2015 with a latest update from 2020. The concept sets out the initial situation in form of a greenhouse gas emissions balance as well as the options for action and names almost 100 measures from eight fields of action in a catalog of measures with which the country's climate protection goals are to be achieved @MinisteriumfurUmweltEnergieErnahrungundForsten.2020b.

**Catalog of measures**: In order to implement the state's climate protection and energy goals of 100% renewable electricity generation by 2030 (most recently confirmed by the state parliament resolution of April 26, 2018) with special respect to the transport and heating sector, further expansion of the use of wind energy is essential. According to the previous expansion forecast for wind energy in RLP, and if the corresponding regulatory framework conditions are created by the federal government, a total of **2,500 plants with a total output of 8,900 MW** and a contribution to renewable electricity generation of 18.7 GWh will be expected in 2030. The expansion of wind energy has declined sharply in the last two to three years. The reasons for this are diverse and relate to deficits in the EEG 2017. Increasing complexity and duration for the planning of new construction projects, as well as approval hurdles and increasing protests in many places lead to litigation. In order to remove existing obstacles and to promote the necessary expansion of wind energy use, in particular repowering projects, whereby several old systems are replaced by a few more powerful systems, the state will advocate the further development of statewide and nationwide framework conditions. Concrete measures for this are:

- Facilitation of repowering projects in the existing legal framework especially the Federal Immission Control Act (Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz - BImSchG). Repowering results in a reduction in the number of installed wind turbines in one location and thus a reduction in imissions when the output is increased. The dismantling of obstacles to approval in the case of new planning and repowering should also be taken into account.
For this purpose, the following measures are to be implemented in accordance with the resolution of the heads of government of the federal states of June 17, 2020 @MinisteriumfurUmweltEnergieErnahrungundForsten.2020b: 

1. Needs-based personnel and technical equipment of the planning and approval authorities
2. Approval structures as central as possible per country 
3. Shortening of instances (the higher administrative courts are to decide in the first instance on disputes in the approval procedure)
4. Elimination of the automatically suspensive effect of objections and lawsuits against approvals
5. Establishment of a central advice center 
6. Conservation-related standardization to simplify the enforcement of species protection law when a permit is issued

- Commitment of the state for a continuous further development of the Renewable Energy Act, especially in relation to the compensation of the location-related disadvantages of wind energy locations in countries remote from the coast. Preservation of the diversity of actors and simplification of models for self-supply and direct supply through EEG surcharge relief if no EEG remuneration is used, as well as the implementation of the European Renewable Energy Sources Directive (REDII) in German law.

- Development of framework conditions, information and advice with regard to new business models, such as Power Purchase Agreements (PPA), longer-term electricity supply contracts between system operators and electricity consumers (e.g. industry or energy supply companies), in particular as an option for the continued operation of wind turbines with ending EEG remuneration and as an alternative business model for EEG remuneration for new systems. It is also important to adapt the EEG to abolish the EEG surcharge on self-supply and direct supply with wind energy electricity (not EEG-remunerated) by the federal government.

## Physical basics

The amount of electricity generated by a wind turbine (the electricity yield) can be derived from the physical relationship between the kinetic energy and the power of the wind. Without claiming to be exhaustive, the following relationship applies[^1]:


\begin{equation}
E_{kin}\; =\; \frac{1}{2}\;mv^2
\end{equation}

The air throughput (mass flow $\hat{m}$) that flows through the area swept by the rotor blades can be calculated by multiplying the air density, rotor area, wind speed and the time interval required[^2]:

\begin{equation}
\hat{m}\;=\;\rho A vt
\end{equation}

The power $P$ is equal to the energy per unit of time $\hat{E}$. The following equationvgives the power of the wind[^3]:

\begin{equation}
P_{wind}\;=\;\hat{E}\;=\;\frac{1}{2}\;\hat{m}v^2\;=\;\frac{1}{2}\; \rho \pi r^2 v^3
\end{equation}

(Mac Kay @DavidJCMacKay.2009 and BWE @BWE.2021)

In Formula 3 it becomes clear that the wind speed is the determining factor for the performance of a WT. Because WTs are built to perform at lower wind speeds, most of the time they are not able to operate at very high wind speeds and have to be taken out of the wind at a certain speed to avoid fatigue and destruction through peak loads. A typical load profile of a WT is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:powerofwind). If the density of air is 1.3 kg/m³ and there is an average windspeed of 6 m/s, which could be realistic for many sites in RLP at 140 m above ground, as seen in Figure \@ref(fig:wind), then the typical power of the wind per square meter of rotor area is[^4]:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}\; \rho v^3\;=\;\frac{1}{2}\;1.3\;kg/m^3\; *\; (6 m/s)^3\;=\;140\; W/m^2\;\;\; [1\; \frac{kg\, m^2}{s^3} = 1\; W]
\end{equation}


\newpage

The curve of power per m\textsuperscript{2} in relation to the wind speed is also shown in Figure \@ref(fig:powerofwind). Of course, not all the wind's power can be converted and there are further losses when converting kinetic energy into electrical energy in the generator.

The maximum theoretical efficiency obtained for wind turbines is 59% according to the Betz Limit @A.Betz.1920; however, in practice it is often around 40% up to a maximum of 50% @WindwartsEnergieausdemNorden.2021. If the average rotor diameter installed in RLP in 2020 is 130 m (Figure \@ref(fig:rotor)) with an efficiency of 50%, then the average power of one WT is[^5]:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
P_{WT}\; & =\; 0.5\; *\; \frac{1}{2}\; \rho v^3\; *\; \frac{\pi}{4}d^2 \\
P_{WT130}\; & =\; 70\; W/m^2\; *\; \frac{\pi}{4}(130 m)^2\; =\; 929\; kW\;=\;8,138\; MWh
\end{split}
\end{equation}


The amount of energy also increases proportionally with increasing rotor diameter which explains why the rotor diameters become larger in practice (Figure \@ref(fig:rotor)). If we assume a rotor diameter of 162 m of a modern WTs the power output increases up to 1,442 kWh which equals to an electricity yield per year of 12,639 MWh. It is said that large WTs with larger rotor diameter have to be spaced further apart. In the literature, values can be found of 3 to 8 times the rotor diameter, depending on the main direction of the wind @DavidJCMacKay.2009. 

\newpage 

If we assume further that WTs in RLP are spaced on average 5 times their diameter apart from each other, from the average power calculated in equation 5 follows that the energy per area of land is:
 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{P_{WT}}{m^2}\; & =\; \frac{\frac{1}{2} \rho v^3\; \frac{\pi}{8}d^2}{(5d)^2} \\
 & =\; \frac{\pi}{200}\; \frac{1}{2}\; \rho v^3 \\
 & =\; 0.016\; *\; 140 W/m^2 \\
 & =\; 2.2\; W/m^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}

This means that independent of the rotor size, there is a limit of around 2.2 W/m\textsuperscript{2} of electrical energy that can be delivered in RLP assuming an average wind speed of about 6 m/s. If we reduce the distance of each WT to 3 times the rotor diameter the output increases to around 6.1 W/m\textsuperscript{2}. In the literature, values for the electric power per area vary from 1 to 7 W/m\textsuperscript{2} land area depending on the site conditions @SvenLinow.2020. Nonetheless, building taller WTs can be beneficial due to higher and more constant wind speeds with increasing height and other economic factors. As a rough estimate it can be said that doubling the height increases wind speed by 10% and therefore increases the power of the wind by 30%. Thus, the hub heights also tend to increase (Figure \@ref(fig:nabe)). The actual way that wind speed increases with height is much more complicated and depends on the roughness of the surrounding area and time and is beyond of the scope of this study. Usually WTs are designed to start operating at wind speeds of around 3 to 5 m/s and stop at around 25 m/s. A WT has a so-called "capacity" or "peak power" which is the maximum power that the WT can generate in optimal conditions. The actual average power that is delivered can be expressed by the capacity multiplied by a factor that describes the fraction of the time that wind conditions are near optimal. This factor is called the "load factor" and as of 2009, a typical load factor was around 19% in Germany,  22% in the Netherlands and 30% in the United Kingdom @DavidJCMacKay.2009. Lastly it can be estimated how much area is needed when we assume a constant electricity yield of 2.2 W/m\textsuperscript{2} and an electricity demand of 22 TWh per year in RLP:

\begin{equation}
A_{22TWh}\;=\;\frac{22 * 10^{12}\; Wh}{2.2\;W/m^2\; *\; 8760h\; *\; 10^6}\;=\;1140.9\;km^2
\end{equation} 

The total area of RLP is 19,858 km\textsuperscript{2}, which means that the desired amount of electricity coming from wind energy would be equivalent to covering roughly 5.8% of the area with WTs. The actual 6.782 TWh of electrical energy generated in RLP would relate to 351.7 km\textsuperscript{2} which means that currently about 1.8% of the area of RLP is covered with WTs given the previously defined assumptions are true. If the same calculation for the whole of Germany is done, the demanded 655 TWh in 2030 would need an area of about 33,968 km\textsuperscript{2} which is about 9.5% of the total area. Whereas the area consumption for RLP is still somehow imaginable it is clear that covering nearly 10%  of Germany with WTs is very uncertain. It should also be noted, that the assumption of an average wind speed of 6 m/s could be an under- or overestimate and the area consumption is different in practice. In Chapters 3 and 4 the actual numbers for RLP are presented and therefore allow for an evaluation of this theoretical approximation.
For further explanation of the technical development and the calculation methodology, the study of the German WindGuard (DWG) "Full-Load-Hours Of Wind Turbines On Land - Development, Influences, Effects" from October 5th, 2020 @RasmusBorrmannDr.KnudRehfeldtDr.DennisKruse.2020, is used as a guide and the relevant results are presented in the next subsection. 


## Technical concepts and development

The study of DWG examines the development of full-load-hours and thus the wind energy potential in Germany and is divided into the sub-areas Schleswig-Holstein (SH), north (Norden), centre (Mitte) and south (Süden) @RasmusBorrmannDr.KnudRehfeldtDr.DennisKruse.2020. RLP is part of the southern region. The full-load-hours are a measure of the degree of utilization of a power generation plant and denote the time that a plant would have to be operated at nominal load in order to achieve the same power production as it has achieved over the entire reference period with fluctuating generation capacity. The full-load-hours per year are calculated from the quotient of the annual energy yield and the nominal output also called as rated capacity, which means the gain in information is limited. However, knowing the average full-load-hours of all wind turbines and their development is of great importance, as it establishes the connection between installed power and expected energy yield within a certain area. For a forward-looking political control of the future share of wind energy in the energy transition, an assumption for the full-load-hours to be expected in the future is necessary. The aim of the presented study is to make an assessment of the future development of the full-load-hours of wind turbines on land. Furthermore, it should be estimated what total energy yield is possible with the expected system technology on all designated areas. The development of the full-load-hours in different parts of Germany can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:flh). The graph shows an average of around 2,050 h for the south of Germany in 2017 with a predicted increase up to around 2,450 h in 2030.

The study of DWG suggests that the wind energy potential, i.e., the theoretical electricity yield of a wind turbine for future systems, can be calculated using the following formula:
$$
Electricity\;yield\; =\; Full-load-hours\; *\; Capacity
$$  
The capacity is the installed nominal output, also called rated capacity of the generator and can be found in the technical details of a wind turbine generator. The development of the installed nominal power depending on the commissioning date in Germany can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:capacity).

```{r capacity, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Development and forecast of the mean rated capacity (in kW) for Wind turbines installed in Germany. Figure taken from Deutsche WindGuard 2020 (ref:DWG).", out.width = "100%", fig.pos="H"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/DWG/DWG_Nennleistung.png")
```

With a fixed nominal output, a high full-load hourly value is also associated with a high energy yield. For example, the full load hours achieved by a WT in different years can be compared well with one another in order to make a statement about the electricity yield for a year. However, if two WTs have the same hub height and the same rotor diameter, but a different rated capacity, the less powerful WT, i.e., the WT with the lower specific rated capacity, will achieve more full-load-hours but a lower annual energy yield at the same wind speeds. The full-load-hourly value should therefore always be considered and evaluated in connection with the energy yield. The development of the rotor diameter and hub height is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:rotor) and \@ref(fig:nabe).

The specific nominal power represents the relationship between the nominal power of the turbine and the swept rotor area. The specific nominal power of the turbines has tended to decrease since 2012, which is due to the increasing rotor diameters (Figure \@ref(fig:rotor)). Systems with a lower specific nominal output, i.e., comparatively larger rotors, have more full-load-hours under the same wind conditions or achieve their nominal output at lower wind speeds and are therefore also referred to as low-wind systems. If two systems are compared with the same rotor diameter, the system with a higher absolute and therefore also specific nominal output is always more expensive and is therefore only suitable for comparatively higher wind speeds. Due to the prevailing conditions in RLP, low-wind turbines with a lower specific nominal output are more important in repowering than the increase in absolute turbine output. However, the value of the specific rated capacity in southern Germany is currently stagnating at approx. 270 W/m\textsuperscript{2} as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:spec). Because the full-load-hours depend largely on the rated capacity and the wind speed in addition to technical influences, they are a useful indicator for calculating the expected electricity yield if there is no data on electricity yields from existing systems and only technical details and site conditions are available. The mean value of the full-load-hours of all wind turbines, e.g., for a federal state, can be used as a parameter to infer the future electricity yield from the installed rated capacity @RasmusBorrmannDr.KnudRehfeldtDr.DennisKruse.2020.

## Résumé
This section will briefly summarize the main points that have been presented regarding the main trends of development that are important for onshore WTs and are related to the calculations and findings of this thesis. The study of DWG shows how the technology of onshore wind turbines has continued to develop since 2000. A clear trend for an increase in the average rated capacity and the average rotor diameter of the newly commissioned systems can be seen. The mean total height of the turbines is also increasing, although this increase has been due to the increase in the mean rotor diameter for some years while the height of the lower blade tip remains the same. This also leads to an increase in the mean hub height. It is assumed that these trends will continue over the next ten years. A look at the configuration of the latest system models from different manufacturers supports this thesis @VestasWindSystemsAS.2019. The development of offshore wind turbines suggests that even with a rotor diameter of 170 m and a nominal output of 6.6 MW no end of the system scaling is to be expected, where significantly larger systems are already available. However, the requirements regarding the construction are clearly different as well as the wind speeds at sea and thus the rotor diameter are of course not easy to transfer. In order to calculate the wind energy potential specifically for RLP in the context of climate change as described earlier, the methodology used in this thesis is partly adopted from the study of the DWG. Modern data processing with R is used to estimate the electricity yield of future WTs in RLP. The following chapter therefore describes the methodology developed for the analysis of the master and movement data from Amprion of 2012-2019. Additionally the area consumption of WTs in RLP is being assessed using the market master data register.
