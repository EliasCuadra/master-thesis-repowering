## Technical basics and development

Wind energy has been used by humans for thousands of years, but the generation of electrical power has only been possible since the 19th century with the beginning of industrialization and is now the subject of constant research and development in the context of the energy transition @Wikipedia.2021. A wind turbine usually consists of the three main components rotor blades, nacelle and tower. The nacelle contains besides other elements the gearbox, the generator, the transformer and the control system @MladenBosnjakovic.2013. The mostly three rotor blades are attached to the rotor hub and absorb the kinetic energy of the wind and convert it into a rotary motion. If the winds are too strong, the rotor blades can be “taken out of the wind” by adjusting the blades, thus protecting the system from damage. Mainly the gearbox and the generator convert the kinetic energy into electricity. However, there are also systems with direct drive and without gear. The nacelle can be rotated to an optimal position when the wind conditions change, and an electromagnetic brake helps to shut down the system when the winds are too strong or during maintenance work. In addition to its load-bearing function, the tower also contains the power lines that conduct electricity to the grid connection of the distribution network @NetzKonstrukteur.16.11.2020.

The transmission system operators, in this case Amprion, are obliged to publish master and so-called movement data for each calendar year in accordance with section 77 Renewable Energy Act 2017 @Bundesgestzblatt.2017. These movement data include the annual electricity generation and the underlying tariff for each renewable energy system. The movement data for RLP are currently available until 2019. The total amount of electricity fed in with remuneration in 2019 from wind turbines in RLP is 6,782,180,753 kWh, i.e. approx. 6.782 TWh @EnergieagenturRheinlandPfalz.2019.

The amount of electricity generated by a wind turbine, the electricity yield, can be derived from the physical relationship between the kinetic energy and the power of the wind. Without claiming to be exhaustive, the following applies[^1]:


\begin{equation}
E_{kin} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\end{equation}

The air throughput or mass flow $\hat{m}$ that flows through the area swept by the rotor blades in a certain time can be calculated by multiplying the air density, rotor area and wind speed as well as the time interval required with[^2]:

\begin{equation}
\hat{m}=\rho A V
\end{equation}

The power P is equal to the energy per unit of time $\hat{E}$. This results in the power of the wind with[^3]:

\begin{equation}
P_{wind}=\hat{E}=\frac{1}{2}\hat{m}v^2=\frac{1}{2} \rho \pi r^2 v^3
\end{equation}

(Mac Kay @DavidJCMacKay.2009 and BWE @BWE.2021)

Of course, not all the wind's power can be converted and there are further losses when converting kinetic energy into electrical energy in the generator. The efficiency in theory after Alber Betz is a maximum of 59 % also called the Betz limit @A.Betz.1920, but in practice it is often around 40 % to a maximum of 50 % @WindwartsEnergieausdemNorden.2021. In Formula 3, however, it becomes clear that the wind speed is the decisive factor for the performance of a wind turbine. If the wind speed increases three times, the power is 27 times greater. It can also be seen that the amount of energy increases proportionally with increasing rotor diameter. This explains why the rotor diameters become larger in practice. Due to higher and more constant wind speed with increasing height, the hub heights also increase.

The development of the rotor diameter and hub heights are shown in figures \@ref(fig:rotor) and \@ref(fig:nabe). For the classification of the technical development and the calculation method, the study of the German Wind Guard (DWG) "Full load hours of wind turbines on land - development, influences, effects" from October 5th, 2020 @RasmusBorrmannDr.KnudRehfeldtDr.DennisKruse.2020, is used as a guide and its results are presented. The study examines the development of the full load hours and thus also the wind energy potential in Germany and is divided into the sub-areas Schleswig-Holstein (SH), north (Norden), centre (Mitte) and south (Süden). RLP is part of the southern region. The study of DWG suggests that the wind energy potential, i.e. the theoretical electricity yield of a wind turbine for future systems, can and will be calculated in this work using the following formula:
$$
Electricity\;yield\; =\; Full\;load\;hours\; *\; Capacity
$$  


```{r rotor, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Development and forecast of the mean rotor diameter according to Deutsche WindGuard, 2020", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/DWG/DWG_Rotordurchmesser.png")
```

```{r nabe, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Development and forecast of mean hub hight according to Deutsche WindGuard, 2020", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/DWG/DWG_Nabenhöhe.png")
```


\newpage
The capacity is the installed nominal output, also called **rated capacity** of the generator and can be found in the technical details of a wind turbine generator. The development of the installed nominal power depending on the commissioning date in Germany can be seen in figure \@ref(fig:capacity).

```{r capacity, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Development and forecast of the mean rated capacity according to Deutsche WindGuard, 2020", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/DWG/DWG_Nennleistung.png")
```

The **full load hours** are formed from the quotient of the annual electricity yield and the rated capacity and are an indicator of the degree of utilization of a wind turbine. The full load hours number the hours that the system would have to be operated under nominal load in order to deliver the amount of electricity generated and do not reflect the actual operating time below nominal load. Since the full load hours result from the electricity yield and the installed nominal power, there is a dependency and the gain in information is limited. However, the full load hours are a useful concept in order to be able to draw conclusions about the electricity yield and, therefore, analysis of the full load hours of RLP are presented in Section 3.2.3. The development of full load hours in Germany can be seen in figure \@ref(fig:flh).

```{r flh, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Development and forecast of the mean full load hours according to Deutsche WindGuard, 2020", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/DWG/DWG_Volllaststunden.png")
```

If two plants have the same hub height and the same rotor diameter, but a different nominal power, the less powerful plant, i.e. the plant with the lower **specific nominal power**, will achieve more full-load hours but a lower annual energy yield at the same wind speeds. The full load hourly value should therefore always be considered and evaluated in connection with the energy yield. The specific nominal power represents the relationship between the nominal power of the turbine and the swept rotor area. The specific nominal power of the turbines has tended to decrease since 2012, which is due to the increasing rotor diameters figure \@ref(fig:rotor). Systems with a lower specific nominal output, i.e. comparatively larger rotors, have more full-load hours under the same wind conditions or achieve their nominal output at lower wind speeds and are therefore also referred to as low-wind systems. If you compare two systems with the same rotor diameter, the system with a higher absolute and therefore also specific nominal output is always more expensive and is therefore only suitable for comparatively higher wind speeds. Due to the prevailing conditions in RLP, low-wind turbines with a lower specific nominal output are more important in repowering than the increase in absolute turbine output. However, the value of the specific rated capacity in southern Germany is currently stagnating at approx. 270 W / m² seen in figure \@ref(fig:spec). Because the full load hours depend largely on the rated capacity and the wind speed in addition to technical influences, they are a useful indicator for calculating the expected electricity yield if there is no data on electricity yields from existing systems, only technical details and site conditions are available. The mean value of the full load hours of all wind turbines, e.g. of a federal state, can be used as a parameter to infer the future electricity yield from the installed rated capacity.

## Résumé and trends of development
The study of DWG shows how the technology of onshore wind turbines has developed further since 2000. A clear trend for an increase in the average rated capacity and the average rotor diameter of the newly commissioned systems can be shown. The mean total height of the turbines is also increasing, although this increase has been due to the increase in the mean rotor diameter for some years while the height of the lower blade tip remains the same. This also leads to an increase in the mean hub height. It is assumed that these trends will continue over the next ten years. A look at the configuration of the latest system models from different manufacturers supports this thesis (Enercon and Vestas, 2021). The development of offshore wind turbines suggests that even with a rotor diameter of 170 m and a nominal output of 6.6 MW no end of the system scaling is to be expected, where significantly larger systems are already available. However, the requirements regarding the construction are clearly different and the wind speeds at sea and thus the rotor diameter are of course not easy to transfer. –Source about other technical limitations-
