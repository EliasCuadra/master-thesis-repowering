# Introduction

This work was executed and written in scientific recognition of the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and expanding renewable energies to mitigate the effects of climate change.

This study was also carried out on behalf of the state-owned energy agency @EnergieagenturRheinlandPfalz.2021 within the project “municipal greenhouse gas accounting and regional climate protection portals in Rhineland-Palatinate” @KomBiReK.2021, which is funded by the “European Regional Development Fund” @EuropeanRegionalDevelopmentFund.2021 and the state of Rhineland-Palatinate (RLP). This project supports the creation of municipal climate protection measures in order to achieve the climate protection goals of the municipalities and the state and thereby increases regional added value, ensures sustainability and thus improves the quality of life of all citizens. When developing municipal climate protection, a sound strategy is required regarding the legally anchored striving for climate neutrality of the state of RLP @RheinlandPfalz.19.08.2014. Even more pressure comes from the recent press release No. 31/2021 of April 29 in 2021 @Bundesverfassungsgericht.24.03.2021, in which the first Senate of the Federal Constitutional Court decided that the regulations of the Climate Protection Act of December 12 in 2019 @BundesamtfurJustiz.2019 on the national climate protection targets and the annual emission quantities permitted up to 2030 are incompatible with fundamental rights, as there are no sufficient criteria for further emission reductions from 2031 onward. It is stated that the legal requirements are not sufficient to bring about a timely transition to climate neutrality. The German legislature has therefore published an adjusted edition of this act that strives for a faster development of renewable energies and the energy transition in general @BundesministeriumfurUmweltNaturschutzundnukleareSicherheit.12.05.2021. This shows that this study is highly embedded in a socio-economic context. The energy transition is a cornerstone of a decent strategy to climate neutrality and RLP wants to play a pioneering role in the implementation of  the energy transition. The state government publishes on its website that RLP will cover 100 % of its electricity needs from renewable energies by 2030 @LandesregierungRheinlandPfalz.2021. In addition to energy from the sun, water and biomass, two thirds of the electricity generated in 2030 should come from wind power and is therefore the subject of this master thesis. The study area and the modeled wind speeds taken from the Windatlas RLP @MinisteriumfurWirtschaftKlimaschutzEnergieundLandesplanung.2013 are seen in figure \@ref(fig:wind).

The gross electricity generation in RLP from wind power rose in 2017 with 5.9 TWh to 29 % of the total 20.7 TWh generated electricity. The total consumption in the same year was 29.1 TWh @Lehnert.2020. In the year 2019 the electricity generation from wind turbines (WT's) was already more than 6.7 TWh. It can be assumed that, on the one hand, electricity consumption will increase in the future due to the electrification of transport and domestic heating, and on the other hand, efficiency measures can also lead to a lower energy consumption. Whereas some past studies and scenarios estimated a slight increase and some a slight decrease but on average a relatively unchanged electricity consumption in Germany which is currently about 560 TWh @NormanGerhardt.2015, the newest press release of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy makes it clear that an increase of the previous predictions of about 12 %  from 580 to 655 TWh is expected @AndreasMertens.13.07.2021, and further studies will follow in the autumn of 2021. In order to achieve the self-set goals of using two thirds of the electricity demand from wind power with an estimated electricity demand of 33 TWh in 2030 in RLP, electricity supply from WT’s must be about 22 TWh per year if RLP wants to become independent of electricity imports. There are two ways of increasing the amount of electricity generated by wind energy. On the one hand, areas that are still available can be identified and built on with new WT’s. On the other hand, existing old systems, whose absolute electricity feed-in quantity is low, can be replaced by new, higher and more efficient systems through the so-called "repowering".
The aim of this work is to develop a methodology for calculating the wind energy potential and its related area consumption at a state level. With this results an evaluation of the desired expansion targets should be assessed. The central three questions of this work are therefore:

1.	How much electric energy can be generated by a new wind turbine from 2021 until 2030 in RLP per area?

2.	How large is the potential when all wind turbines with a commissioning date before 2005 are repowered?

3.	How much area is needed to generate the target amount of 22 TWh out of wind energy?

In order to answer these questions, the technical fundamentals of the electricity yield from WT’s are explained first. Subsequently, the master and movement data provided by the transmission system operator Amprion, which contains all electricity fed into the public grid by WT’s and other technical information, is analyzed and forecasted up to the year 2030. The respective area consumption to generate that electricity is calculated using a GIS based approach and data from the market master data register (Marktstammdatenregister - MaStR). As a by-product the greenhouse gas reduction potential can be derived from the potential for electricity generation. Knowing the electricity potential per area, the required area for the generation targets can be calculated and an assessment of the given expectations can be made subsequently.
