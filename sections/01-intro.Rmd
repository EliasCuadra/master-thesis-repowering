# Introduction

This work was executed and written in scientific recognition of the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and expanding renewable energies to mitigate the effects of climate change.

This study was also carried out on behalf of the state-owned Energy Agency of Rhineland-Palatinate @EnergieagenturRheinlandPfalz.2021 within the project "Municipal Greenhouse Gas Accounting and Regional Climate Protection Portals in Rhineland-Palatinate" @KomBiReK.2021, which is funded by the European Regional Development Fund @EuropeanRegionalDevelopmentFund.2021 and the state of Rhineland-Palatinate (RLP). This project supports the creation of municipal climate protection measures in order to mitigate CO\textsubscript{2} emissions and achieve the climate protection goals of the municipalities and the state and thereby increases regional added value, ensures sustainability and thus improves the quality of life of all citizens. The State Climate Protection Act (Landesklimaschutzgesetz - LKSG) came into force on 23 August 2014 and states that the total of all greenhouse gas emissions in Rhineland-Palatinate have to be reduced by at least 40% by 2020 compared to the base year 1990. Further the aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 100% by 2050, but at least by 90% @RheinlandPfalz.19.08.2014. More pressure comes from the recent press release No. 31 from April 29, 2021 @Bundesverfassungsgericht.24.03.2021 of the first Senate of the Federal Constitutional Court in which is stated that the regulations of the Climate Protection Act December 12, 2019 @BundesamtfurJustiz.2019 on the national climate protection targets and the annual emission quantities permitted up to 2030 are incompatible with fundamental rights, as there are no sufficient criteria for further emission reductions from 2031 onward. It is stated that the legal requirements are not sufficient to bring about a timely transition to climate neutrality. The German legislature has therefore published an adjusted edition of this act that strives for a faster development of renewable energies and the energy transition in general @BundesministeriumfurUmweltNaturschutzundnukleareSicherheit.12.05.2021. Likewise the coalition agreement from 2021 to 2026 of the current government of RLP desires the goal of “100% renewable energies by 2030” and it can be assumed that the Climate Protection Act will be amended. This shows that this study is very topical and also highly embedded in a dynamic socio-economic context @SPDGruneFDP.2021. Thus, the energy transition is regarded as a cornerstone of the strategy to climate neutrality and RLP wants to play a pioneering role in the implementation of the energy transition . In addition to energy from the sun, water and biomass, two thirds of the electricity generated in 2030 should come from wind power and is therefore the subject of this master thesis @LandesregierungRheinlandPfalz.2021. 

As of 2017, the gross electricity generation in RLP from wind power was 5.9 TWh, which was 29% of the total 20.7 TWh of electricity generated in the state @Lehnert.2020. By 2019, the electricity generated from wind turbines (WTs) has already increased to more than 6.7 TWh @AmprionGmbH.2019. It can be assumed that, on the one hand, electricity consumption will increase in the future due to the electrification of transport and domestic heating, and on the other hand, efficiency measures can also lead to a lower energy consumption. Whereas, some past studies and scenarios estimated a slight increase and others a slight decrease but on average a relatively unchanged electricity consumption in Germany, which is currently about 560 TWh @NormanGerhardt.2015, the newest press release of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy makes it very clear. An increase to a previous prediction of about 12% from 580 to 655 TWh is expected @AndreasMertens.13.07.2021, and further studies will follow in the autumn of 2021. If RLP wants to become independent of electricity imports and achieve the self-set goals of covering two thirds of the electricity consumption from wind power with an estimated electricity demand of 33 TWh in 2030, electricity supply from WTs must be about 22 TWh per year. There are two ways of increasing the amount of electricity generated by wind energy. Either areas can be used that have already been identified as suitable for WTs but have not yet been built on, or else, existing old systems whose absolute electricity feed-in quantity is low, can be replaced by new, taller and more efficient systems through the so-called "repowering".

The aim of this work is to develop a method for calculating the wind energy potential and its related area consumption at a state level regarding the two described options. The objective is then to evaluate the desired expansion and emission reduction targets up to 2030 and assess weather they are realistic and in line with the current distance rules and approval procedures and give recommendations for policy makers. Accordingly, the central three questions of this work are:

1.	How much electricity can be generated by a new WT from 2021 until 2030 in RLP per area?

2.	What is the potential when all wind turbines with built before 2005 are repowered?

3.	How much area is needed to generate the target amount of 22 TWh?

In order to answer these questions the data analysis and results of the master and movement data provided by the transmission system operator Amprion and of the market master data register (Marktstammdatenregister - MaStR) is Presented in chapter 3 and 4. The gained results are discussed subsequently in chapter 5 and the paper ends with a summary of the main findings and a recommendation to policy makers in the concluding chapter number 6. To introduce the reader with all the necessary background information on the topic, the scientific and technical fundamentals, that are a prerequisite to this thesis and the assessment of the electricity yield from onshore WTs in RLP, are explained in the following chapter number 2.
